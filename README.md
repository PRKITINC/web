# PRKit

## Develop

Parkit was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, and based on the Hydra template.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~
